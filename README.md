Learned to:
+ Make a basic HTML boilerplate
+ Make headers, paragraphs, basic text formatting styles
+ Add images
+ Distinguish between absolute and relative links
+ Make ordered and unordered lists
+ Basic properties
+ Selector types and groupings
+ Adding CSS to HTML (exernal, internal, inline)
+ Cascading (rules of specificity and such, yk, the works)

Very cool! (^-^)
